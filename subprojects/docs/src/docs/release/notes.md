## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Support version ranges in parent elements

Gradle now suppoprts version range in parent elements of POM, which was introduced by [Maven 3.2.2](https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.2.2/release-notes.html):

> Parent elements can now use bounded ranges in the version specification. You can now consistently use ranges for all intra-project dependencies, of which parents are a special case but still considered a dependency of projects that inherit from them. The following is now permissible:

```
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.apache</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache</artifactId>
    <version>[3.0,4.0)</version>
  </parent>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.its.mng2199</groupId>
  <artifactId>valid</artifactId>
  <version>1</version>
  <packaging>pom</packaging>
</project>
```

IMPORTANT: if this is a patch release, ensure that a prominent link is included in the foreword to all releases of the same minor stream.

### Eclipse plugin separates output folders

The `eclipse` plugin now defines separate output directories for each source folders. Also, each source folder and dependency defines an additional `gradle_source_sets` classpath attribute. The attribute specifies to which sourceSet the entry belonged. Future [Buildship](http://eclipse.org/buildship) versions will use this information to separate source sets when launching Java applications within Eclipse.

### Parametrized tooling model builders.

The Tooling API now allows model builders to accept parameters from the tooling client. This is useful when there are multiple possible mappings from the Gradle project to the tooling model and the decision depends on some user-provided value.
Android Studio for instance will use this API to request just the dependencies for the variant that the user currently selected in the UI. This will greatly reduce synchronization times.

For more information see the [documentation](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/provider/model/ParametrizedToolingModelBuilder.html) of the new API.

## Promoted features

### Changes in the `eclipse` plugin
